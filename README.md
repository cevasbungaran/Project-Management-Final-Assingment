# Project Management Course Final Assgingment
This is my final assingment in 7th semester.

I did this assingment with 5 people, and in this assingment I'm the project manager.
We made a fullstack weather forecast website. My team contains of 6 people including me, so I made 2 sub-team. Front-end team and back-end team.
The back-end team developed a model for predicting a weather based on humidity, rainfall, and sunshine. The front-end team developed the website.
